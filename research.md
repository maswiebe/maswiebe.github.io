*How many jobs can be done remotely? A reanalysis of Dingel and Neiman (2020)* ([I4R discussion paper](https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/318266)), May 2025.
- The authors report that 37% of jobs in the US can be performed at home. But small changes to the classification algorithm give estimates of 25% and 59%.

*Comment on "Supply Constraints do not Explain House Price and Quantity Growth Across U.S. Cities"* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/supply_constraints/supply_constraints.pdf)), May 2025.
- I show that the equations in Louie et al. (2025) are incorrect, because they do not use exogenous variation in housing demand.

*Spillover effects of cash transfers: Reanalysis of Egger et al. (2022)* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/cash_spillover/cash_spillover.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/cash_spillover)), September 2024.
- As part of GiveWell's [evaluation](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/givedirectly-cash-for-poverty-relief-program) of GiveDirectly, I reanalyzed Egger et al. (2022) on the general equilibrium effects of a cash transfer program in Kenya. I find mixed evidence that spillovers accrue to richer households. The main findings are robust.

*Do gasoline price shocks during adolescence reduce driving as an adult? A replication exercise* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/formative_gas/formative_gas.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/formative_gas)), June 2024.
- I reanalyze the results in Severen and Bethem (2022). I find supporting evidence for the claim that gas price shocks reduce adult driving, with different effects for price increases and decreases.

*Administrative procedures as tax enforcement tools*, with Jeff Hicks and Wei Cui, [Economics Letters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176524001320), April 2024.
- Why do Chinese firms report income just above a threshold that doubles their tax rate?

*Do subway openings reduce air pollution? A replication exercise* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/subway_pollution/subway_pollution.pdf), [I4R discussion paper](https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/295250), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/subway_pollution)), March 2024.
- I reanalyze the results in Gendron-Carrier et al. (2022). I find that the main result (new subways in high-pollution cities reduce pollution) is robust, while the effects for low-pollution cities are mixed.

*Can we detect the long-run effects of the measles vaccine? Replicating Atwood and Pearlman (2023)* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/measles_mexico/ap_replication.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/measles_mexico)), February 2024.
- I run the same analysis from my [comment](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/atwood/atwood_comment) on Atwood (2022) in the context of the Mexico measles vaccine, and again find that the results are explained by trends.

*The Long-Term Effects of Measles Vaccination on Earnings and Employment: Comment* ([html](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/atwood/atwood_comment), [pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/atwood/atwood_comment.pdf), [I4R discussion paper](https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/305225), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/atwood_comment)), January 2024.
- I run an event study and find that the results in Atwood (2022) are explained by trends, instead of a treatment effect of the vaccine.
- *Extended Commentary on Atwood (2022)*, ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/atwood/atwood_extended.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/atwood_extended)): additional results on the the event study, heterogeneous effects, plotting the raw data, redoing the disease event study, and more.

*The Effect of High-Tech Clusters on the Productivity of Top Inventors: Comment* ([summary](https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/2024/01/moretti_summary), [html](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/moretti/moretti_comment), [pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/moretti/moretti_comment.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/moretti_comment), [code walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXpGyd5wMos)), November 2023; [resubmitted March 2025, AER].
- I show that the results from the event study and IV regressions in Moretti (2021) are caused by coding errors.
- *Extended Commentary on Moretti (2021)* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/moretti/moretti_extended.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/moretti_extended)): additional results on the event study and IV, heterogeneity by top-10% and bottom-90% inventors, heterogeneity by movers and stayers, testing the mechanism, imputing missing observations, and more.

*Can we detect the effects of racial violence on patenting? Reanalyzing Cook (2014)* ([html](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/cook_reanalysis), [pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/cook_reanalysis.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/cook_reanalysis)), September 2023. Published in [Econ Journal Watch](https://econjwatch.org/articles/can-we-detect-the-effects-of-racial-violence-on-patenting-reanalyzing-an-article-by-lisa-cook), Oct. 2024.
- The results in Cook (2014) don't hold up to scrutiny.
- [Response](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/cook_reanalysis/response_to_ei_referees.pdf) to referee reports (Economic Inquiry)

*Replicating the literature on prefecture-level meritocratic promotion in China* ([html](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/promotion), [pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/promotion.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/promotion)), September 2023.
([2020 version](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/ch2.pdf)).
Published in [Research and Politics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20531680241229875), Feb. 2024.
- A popular idea is that Chinese mayors are promoted based on GDP growth. I show that the evidence in the literature is not robust.

---

*Does meritocratic promotion explain Chinaâ€™s growth?* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/ch1.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/meritocratic_promotion)), 2020.
- Using my own data, I find no evidence that prefecture leaders are promoted based on GDP growth.
