*Administrative procedures as tax enforcement tools*, with Jeff Hicks and Wei Cui, [Economics Letters](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/subway_pollution/subway_pollution.pdf), April 2024.
- Why do Chinese firms report income just above a threshold that doubles their tax rate?

*Do subway openings reduce air pollution? A replication exercise* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/subway_pollution/subway_pollution.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/subway_pollution)), March 2024.
- I reanalyze the results in Gendron-Carrier et al. (2022). I find that the main result (new subways in high-pollution cities reduce pollution) is robust, while the effects for low-pollution cities are mixed.

*Can we detect the long-run effects of the measles vaccine? Replicating Atwood and Pearlman (2023)* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/measles_mexico/ap_replication.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/measles_mexico)), February 2024.
- I run the same analysis from my [comment](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/atwood/atwood_comment) on Atwood (2022) in the context of the Mexico measles vaccine, and again find that the results are explained by trends.

*The Long-Term Effects of Measles Vaccination on Earnings and Employment: Comment* ([html](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/atwood/atwood_comment), [pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/atwood/atwood_comment.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/atwood_comment)), January 2024.
- I run an event study and find that the results in Atwood (2022) are explained by trends, instead of a treatment effect of the vaccine.
- *Extended Commentary on Atwood (2022)*, ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/atwood/atwood_extended.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/atwood_extended)): additional results on the the event study, heterogeneous effects, plotting the raw data, redoing the disease event study, and more.

*The Effect of High-Tech Clusters on the Productivity of Top Inventors: Comment* ([summary](https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/2024/01/moretti_summary), [html](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/moretti/moretti_comment), [pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/moretti/moretti_comment.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/moretti_comment), [code walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXpGyd5wMos)), November 2023.
- I show that the results from the event study and IV regressions in Moretti (2021) are caused by coding errors.
- *Extended Commentary on Moretti (2021)* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/moretti/moretti_extended.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/moretti_extended)): additional results on the event study and IV, heterogeneity by top-10% and bottom-90% inventors, heterogeneity by movers and stayers, testing the mechanism, imputing missing observations, and more.

*Can we detect the effects of racial violence on patenting? Reanalyzing Cook (2014)* ([html](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/cook_reanalysis), [pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/cook_reanalysis.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/cook_reanalysis)), September 2023.
- The results in Cook (2014) don't hold up to scrutiny.

*Replicating the literature on prefecture-level meritocratic promotion in China* ([html](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/promotion), [pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/promotion.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/promotion)), September 2023.
([2020 version](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/ch2.pdf)).
Published in [Research and Politics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20531680241229875), Feb. 2024.
- A popular idea is that Chinese mayors are promoted based on GDP growth. I show that the evidence in the literature is not robust.

*Does meritocratic promotion explain Chinaâ€™s growth?* ([pdf](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/ch1.pdf), [code](https://github.com/maswiebe/meritocratic_promotion)), 2020.
- Using my own data, I find no evidence that prefecture leaders are promoted based on GDP growth.
