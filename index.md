I'm a data scientist and economist. [Hire me](https://michaelwiebe.com/hire-me/)!

I graduated with a PhD in Economics from the University of British Columbia in 2020.

In my dissertation, I replicated the literature on meritocratic promotion in China. The idea is that mayors are promoted based on GDP growth, but I found that the evidence didn't hold up under scrutiny. Read about it [here](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/promotion).

You can find my research [here](https://michaelwiebe.com/research/) and read my blog posts [here](https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/).
