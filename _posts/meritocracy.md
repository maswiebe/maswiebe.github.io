One explanation for China's rapid economic growth is meritocratic
promotion, where politicians with higher GDP growth are rewarded with
promotion. In this system, politicians compete against each other in
'promotion tournaments' where the highest growth rate wins. This
competition incentivizes politicians to grow the economy, and hence
helps explain the stunning economic rise of China.

The literature on meritocratic promotion finds evidence of meritocracy
for province, prefecture, and county leaders.[^1] However, as I discuss
in my [dissertation](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/ch1.pdf), the evidence for province and prefecture leaders is
weak. In the provincial literature, the initial positive finding was not
confirmed in follow-up studies. And when I [replicated](https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/2021/02/replications) the prefecture
literature, I found that the results there were not robust. So we don't
have strong evidence that province and prefecture leaders are promoted
based on GDP growth. But, using data from two papers, I did find some
evidence for meritocratic promotion of county leaders (details [here](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/ch2.pdf)).

So how should we think about meritocracy in China? Despite the lack of
evidence for meritocratic promotion at the province and prefecture
levels, it's still plausible that meritocracy has contributed to China's
growth. Let's grant that county leaders are promoted meritocratically,
directly incentivizing them to boost GDP growth.[^2] This means that
high-growth county leaders are promoted to prefecture positions. But
since prefecture leaders then consist only of high-growth leaders, there
isn't enough variation in growth to implement a prefecture-level
promotion tournament. In other words, range restriction prevents the
Organization Department from implementing meritocratic promotion above
the county level. Running a successful county-level promotion tournament
precludes prefecture and provincial tournaments. Hence, the Organization
Department must use other criteria in determining promotions of
prefecture and provincial leaders.

So county leaders are continuously incentivized to boost economic
growth, and only leaders with demonstrated growth-boosting ability are
promoted to prefecture and provincial positions. While they are not
directly incentivized, these prefecture and province leaders are
selected based on their ability to grow the economy, and they supervise
the county leaders in their prefecture/province. We can think of this as
a version of partial meritocracy, in contrast to a 'maximal' version
where leaders at all levels are incentivized through promotion
tournaments. While the maximal version provides the strongest incentives for
boosting GDP growth, the partial version does generate some incentives
as well.

Thus, despite the lack of evidence at higher levels of government,
meritocracy does partly explain China's economic growth.

[^1]: There are six administrative levels in the Chinese government:
    center, province, prefecture, county, township, and village.

[^2]: Based on my experience replicating the prefecture literature, we
    should wait to see more evidence before drawing firm conclusions for
    county-level meritocracy (e.g., extending the sample period, trying
    different promotion definitions).
