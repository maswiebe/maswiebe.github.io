China has had double-digit economic growth for nearly three decades. How
can we explain this? In my dissertation, I studied one explanation that
is backed up by a large literature: meritocratic promotion. The idea is
that politicians compete in promotion tournaments, where the politician
with the highest GDP growth rate in their jurisdiction is rewarded by
being promoted. By tying promotion to economic growth, meritocratic
promotion creates strong incentives to boost GDP, and hence helps
explain China's rapid growth.

When I collected data on prefecture politicians, however, I found no evidence for
meritocracy: there was no correlation between GDP growth and
promotion, despite trying many different models. How is this null result
consistent with the positive findings in the rest of the literature? To
find out, I replicated the main papers claiming evidence for prefecture-level meritocracy. Short answer:
the literature is wrong.

This post summarizes my replications. I find that the results in the
literature are not robust to reasonable specification changes, or are
due to data errors. You can find the full details, and a few more
replications, in the paper [here](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/ch2.pdf).

Yao and Zhang (2015)
====================

[Yao and Zhang (2015)](https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10887-015-9116-1), published in the Journal of Economic Growth, was
the first paper to study meritocratic promotion at the prefecture level
in China. They estimate leader ability to grow GDP, and then estimate
the relationship between ability and promotion. If promotion is
meritocratic, we should see a positive correlation, as high-growth
leaders are promoted.

However, they find no average correlation between leader ability and
promotion: leaders with higher ability are not more likely to be
promoted. Despite this, the authors do not frame their paper as
contradicting the literature.[^1] Moreover, this paper is cited in the
literature as supporting the meritocracy hypothesis.[^2]

This is because the authors further test for an interaction between
leader ability and age, reporting a positive interaction effect that is
significant at the 5% level. Narrowing in on specific age thresholds,
they find that leader ability has the strongest effect on promotion for
leaders older than 51. They conclude that leader ability matters for
older politicians, because more years of experience produces a clearer
signal of ability.

Now, this result is consistent with a limited promotion tournament,
where the Organization Department promotes older leaders based on their
ability to boost growth (because older leaders have clearer signals of
ability), but applies different promotion criteria to younger leaders
(whose signals are too weak to detect). But this limited model
contradicts the usual characterization of China's promotion tournament
as including all leaders, irrespective of age: in each province, leaders
compete to boost GDP growth, and the winners are rewarded with
promotion.

This is actually a big discrepancy, because half of all promotions occur
for leaders younger than 51. If the Organization Department cannot
measure ability for these young leaders, what criteria does it use to
promote them? Furthermore, remember that the original motivation was to
explain China's rapid growth. The incentives generated by this limited
tournament are weaker, since the reward is only applied later in life;
if young leaders are impatient, they will discount this future reward
and put less effort into boosting growth. The limited tournament model
has less explanatory power.

At this point, it is not clear to me why this paper has been cited
without qualification as evidence for meritocratic promotion. It offers
no general support for meritocracy, and its model of a limited promotion
tournament partly contradicts the literature.

But I'm not stopping here. Finding a null average effect with a
significant interaction is a classic formula for p-hacked results in
social psychology. Since the age interaction doesn't make much sense, I
don't believe that the authors started out planning to run this test.
Rather, it looks like they wanted to find a positive average effect, but
didn't. But they'd already invested a lot of time in collecting the data
and working out a clever identification strategy, so they found an
interaction that got them statistical significance, even if the
interpretation wasn't really consistent. Hence, I [reject their p-value
as invalid](https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/2020/11/pvalues).[^3]

And it turns out that this is the right call. Digging into the paper, I
find that the significant interaction term depends on including
questionable control variables.

When estimating leader ability, the authors regress GDP growth on three
fixed effects (leader, city, year) as well as three covariates: initial
city GDP per capita (by leader term), annual city population, and the
annual provincial inflation rate. I think it makes sense to control for
initial GDP by term. The model includes city effects, so level
differences in growth rates are not an issue. But we might worry that
the variance of idiosyncratic shocks to growth is correlated with city
size, and growth shocks could affect promotion outcomes.

However, it is not clear why population and inflation should be
included. The authors mention that labor migration can drive GDP growth
(p.413), but a leader's policies affect migration, so population is
plausibly a collider or 'bad control', if leader ability affects growth
through good policies that increase migration. The authors provide no
justification for including inflation, which is odd because the
dependent variable (real per capita GDP growth) is already expressed in
real (rather than nominal) terms.

Given the lack of justification for including population and inflation
as covariates, I re-estimate leader ability controlling only for initial
GDP. Using this new estimate of ability, I then replicate their main
results. I again find a nonsignificant average effect of ability on
promotion. But now the interaction with age disappears. The sign remains
positive, but the magnitude of the coefficient drops by half, and the
results are nonsignificant.

So it turns out that Yao and Zhang (2015) offers no evidence for
meritocratic promotion of prefecture leaders.

Li et al. (2019)
================

[Li et al. (2019)](https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/uez018), published in the Economic Journal, studies GDP growth
targets and promotion tournaments in China. They start with the
observation that growth targets are higher at lower levels of the
administration; for example, prefectures set higher targets than do
provinces. Their explanation is that the number of jurisdictions
competing in each promotion tournament is decreasing as one moves down
the hierarchy, which increases the probability of a leader winning the
tournament. As a consequence, leaders exert more effort, and
higher-level governments can set higher growth targets without causing
leaders to quit.

As part of their model, they assume that promotion is meritocratic:
performance (measured by GDP growth) increases the probability of
promotion. Further, they report an original result: the effect of
performance on promotion is increasing in the growth target faced. That
is, a one percentage-point increase in growth will increase a mayor's
chances of promotion by a larger amount when the provincial target
is higher, relative to when the target is lower.

This result seems naturally testable by interacting
$$Growth \times Target$$ in a panel regression, with a predicted positive
coefficient on the interaction term. However, the authors argue that OLS
is invalid, instead reporting results based on maximum likelihood where
promotion is determined by a contest success function. Why does OLS not
apply? "Standard linear regression does not work here partly because
promotion is determined by local officials' own growth rates as well as
by the growth rates of their competitors. The nonlinearity of the
promotion function is another factor that invalidates the OLS
estimation." (p.2906)

But these are not problems for OLS. First, as is standard in this
literature, the promotion tournament can be captured by using prefecture
growth rates relative to the annual provincial growth rate. Second, OLS
is the best linear approximation to a nonlinear conditional expectation
function. So if there is a positive nonlinear relationship between
promotion and growth, we should be expect that it will be detected by
OLS.[^4]

Given the lack of justification for omitting results from linear
regression, I replicate their results using a linear probability model
and logistic regression. First, I test the generic meritocracy
hypothesis. I find that GDP growth has no average effect on promotion.
Next, I do find a positive interaction effect between growth and growth
target, but it's not statistically significant.

This doesn't look good for the authors. OLS is the default method, and
you need a strong justification for not reporting it. But their reasons
are flimsy. Now it looks like they tried OLS, didn't get the result they
wanted, then made up a complicated maximum likelihood model that
delivered significance.

So Li et al. (2019) is another paper that claims to provide evidence for
meritocratic promotion of prefecture leaders, but is unable to back up
those claims.

Chen and Kung (2019)
====================

[Chen and Kung (2019)](https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjy027), published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics,
studies land corruption in China, with secondary results on meritocratic
promotion. The main result is that local politicians provide price
discounts on land sales to firms connected to Politburo members, and
these local politicians are in turn rewarded with promotion up the
bureaucratic ladder.

For provincial leaders, they find a strong effect of land sales on
promotion for secretaries, but not for governors. In contrast, GDP
growth strongly predicts promotion for governors, but not secretaries.
They conclude that "the governor has to rely on himself for promotion,
specifically by improving economic performance or GDP growth in his
jurisdiction \[\...\] only the provincial party secretaries are being
rewarded for their wheeling and dealing\".

They find similar results at the prefecture level: land deals predict
promotion for secretaries, but not for mayors, while GDP growth predicts
promotion for mayors, but not for secretaries. Overall, this supports
the model of party secretaries being responsible for social policy,
while governors (and mayors) are in charge of the economy, with
performance on these tasks determining promotion. Thus, at both province
and prefecture levels, government leaders (governors and mayors) compete
in a promotion tournament based on GDP growth, while party secretaries
do not.

However, Chen and Kung (2019)'s results for prefecture mayors are
questionable, because their promotion data seems wrong. In my data, the
annual promotion rate varies from 5 to 30% (peaking in Congress years),
while the Chen and Kung (2019) data never exceeds 15% and has six years
where the promotion rate is less than 2%. Figure 1 compares the annual promotion rate
from Chen and Kung to my own data as well as the data from Yao and Zhang
(2015) and Li et al. (2019), where each paper uses a binary promotion
variable (and data on prefecture mayors). While the latter three sources broadly agree on the promotion
rate, the Chen and Kung data is a clear outlier. This is obviously
suspect.

![](https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/replication/promotion_all_raw_unbalanced.png)

Furthermore, upon investigating this discrepancy, I discovered apparent
data errors in their promotion variable. The annual promotion variable
is defined to be 1 in the year a mayor is promoted, and 0 otherwise.
However, out of the 201 cases with $$Promotion=1$$, 124 occur *before* the
mayor's last year in office (with the remaining 77 cases occuring in the
last year). Moreover, this variable is equal to 1 multiple times per
spell in 4% of leader spells. Out of 1216 spells, 51 spells have
$$Promotion=1$$ more than once per spell. For example, consider a mayor
who is in office for five years and then promoted; the promotion
variable should be 0 in the first four years, then 1 in the final year.
However, the Chen and Kung data has spells where the promotion variable
is, for example, 0 in the first two years, and 1 in the final three
years.

To fix this error, I obtained the raw mayor data from James Kung, and
used it to generate a corrected annual promotion variable, which is 1
only in a mayor's final year in office (when the mayor is promoted).
This data-coding error more than *doubles* the number of promotions. But
since the Chen and Kung promotion rate is smaller than the rest of the
literature, fixing the data errors in fact makes the disagreement with
the literature even *more* pronounced.

So this promotion data looks pretty lousy. Naturally, we should worry
that their data is driving their finding of meritocratic promotion for
prefecture mayors. To test this, I re-run their analysis using my own
promotion data. I find that the correlation between GDP growth and
promotion is now negative and nonsignificant. So just like the other two
papers, Chen and Kung (2019) also fails to provide evidence for
meritocratic promotion of prefecture leaders.

This is extremely suspicious. Speculating, it looks like the authors had a
nice paper using provincial data, but a referee asked them to extend it
to prefecture leaders. To fit their story, they needed to find an effect
of land sales for secretaries (but not mayors), and an effect of GDP
growth for mayors (but not secretaries). But maybe the data didn't agree,
and their RA had to falsify the mayor promotion data to get the 'correct' result.
This wouldn't be easy for referees to spot, since the replication files didn't include spell-level data.
But how else did they collect such error-ridden data that also just
happened to produce results consistent with their story?

Conclusion
==========

The original study of meritocratic promotion for provincial leaders, [Li
and Zhou (2005)](https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2004.06.009), has been cited over 2500 times. But follow-up work has
repeatedly failed to confirm its finding of a positive correlation
between provincial GDP growth and promotion.[^5] And as I have shown in
this post, attempts to extend the meritocracy story down to prefecture
leaders have also failed.

How did this happen? How could a whole literature get this wrong?

Here's my guess: researchers set a strong prior based on the provincial
result in Li and Zhou (2005), combined with the elegance of the
theoretical model of a promotion tournament. Since the idea of a
promotion tournament is generic, researchers naturally expected it to
apply to prefecture and county politicians as well. In short,
researchers doing follow-up work knew that they had to confirm the
original results.

However, when they studied prefecture leaders and didn't find a positive
correlation between growth and promotion, the researchers had to fiddle
around with their models and data until they got a result that matched
the original. And given the multiplicity of design choices[^6], it
wasn't that difficult to find a specification that yielded statistical
significance.

But why not embrace the null result and contradict the literature? After
all, this is a case where a null result would be interesting, with
adequate statistical power and a well-established consensus. I guess it
was just easier to shoehorn their results to fit in with the literature,
and get the publication, rather than challenge the consensus.

My conclusion is that publication incentives, conformism, and inadequate
peer review led to a literature of false results.

    tournament in China. Using the leader effect estimated for a
    leader's contribution to local growth as the predictor for his or
    her promotion, we refine the approach of earlier studies." (Yao and
    Zhang 2015, p.430)

    their local economies the fastest will be rewarded with promotion to
    higher levels within the Communist hierarchy \[\...\] Empirical
    evidence has indeed shown a strong association between GDP growth
    and promotion (\[\...\] Yao and Zhang, 2015)\".

[^3]: In a [previous post](https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/2020/11/pvalues), I discussed how p-values involve the thought experiment of running the exact same test on many samples of data.
    When designing a test, researchers need to follow a procedure that is consistent with this thought experiment. In particular, they need to design the test independently of the data; this guarantees that they would run the same test on different samples.
    As [Gelman and Loken](https://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ForkingPaths.pdf) put it: "For a p-value to be interpreted as evidence, it requires a strong claim that the same analysis would have been performed had the data been different."
    
    As it happens, Yao has recently posted a [working paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Competence-Loyalty-Tradeoff-in-China%E2%80%99s-Wang-Yao/e43c2d1adff340d9c79ba15da6071f7f913a61d6) re-using the method in Yao and Zhang (2015).
    Like the first paper, the new one also studies how ability affects promotion for prefecture-level leaders, using the same approach to estimate leader effects. Importantly, they update their data on prefecture cities by extending the time series from 2010 to 2017.
    Thus, we have a perfect test case to see whether the same data-analysis decisions would be made when studying the same question and using a different dataset (drawn from the same population).
    
    It turns out that the new paper doesn't interact with age at all!
    Instead, it reports the average effect of ability on promotion, which is now significant, along with a new specification where ability is interacted with political connections (see Table 2).
    So the p-value requirement is not satisfied: the researcher performs different analyses when the data is different.
    Hence, our skepticism of original age interaction turns out to be justified.
    Since the researcher would not run the same test on new samples, the significant p-value is actually invalid and does not count as evidence.

[^4]: One of the authors, Li-An Zhou, was also an author on the first
    paper on meritocratic promotion, Li and Zhou (2005). That paper used
    an ordered probit model, so it is curious that they didn't employ
    the same model again here.

[^5]: Su et al. (2012) claims that the results in Li and Zhou (2005)
    don't replicate, after fixing data errors. Shih et al. (2012) finds
    that political connections, rather than economic growth, explain
    promotion. Jia et al. (2015) finds no average effect, but does
    report an interaction effect with political connections. Sheng
    (2020) finds a meritocratic effect, but only for provincial
    governors during the Jiang Zemin era (1990-2002). In my
    dissertation, I replicate this paper using the data from Jia et al.
    (2015); I find no effect.

[^6]: Here are a few of the [researcher degrees of freedom](https://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ForkingPaths.pdf) available when studying meritocratic promotion: promotion definitions; growth
    definitions (annual vs. cumulative average vs. average GDP growth,
    absolute vs. relative GDP growth \[relative to predecessor vs.
    relative to provincial average vs. relative to both\], real vs.
    nominal GDP, level vs. per capita GDP); regression models (LPM vs.
    probit/logit vs. ordered probit/logit vs. AKM leader effects vs. MLE
    with contest success function vs. proportional hazards model);
    interactions (with age, political connections \[hometown vs. college
    vs. workplace\], provinces of corrupt politicians, time period); data
    construction (annual vs. spell-level), and so on.
