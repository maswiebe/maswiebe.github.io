Condon claims to be a pragmatic empiricist, but actually relies on extreme theoretical scenarios.
He thinks in memes, not models.
The result is an incoherent analysis of housing policy.

# An incoherent theory of land values

Condon's thesis is that rising land values are responsible for increasing housing costs:
>The thesis of this volume [...] is that the housing crisis is not caused by an impeded supply of homes but by the asset value of the land below them. This Rent value is inflated when higher-density homes are authorized, much to the disappointment of those who argue that the housing-affordability problem is caused by constrained supply. (p.177)

In other words, since land is an input into the production of housing, higher land values will drive up housing costs.
And upzoning in particular is a primary cause of higher land values.

This view is superficially plausible. 
As a naive empiricist, Condon has observed rising housing prices and land values coincide with upzonings.
But what is the causal model underlying these correlations?
Condon's model is that upzoning is the primary driver of land values, which in turn cause higher housing prices.

Right away we can find a fatal flaw in this view: in First Shaughnessy, a heritage-protected mansion neighborhood in Vancouver, land values have quadrupled over 20 years, while building values have roughly doubled.
<!-- tripled? starts around 0.3-0.4? -->

(The graph for Vancouver overall is remarkably similar.)
The entire neighborhood of First Shaughnessy is a [heritage conservation area](https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/ODP/odp-heritage-conservation-area.pdf), so we have a clean natural experiment: no upzonings are happening here.
But then what is causing the increase in land values?
Condon has no answer.
He could appeal to speculators bidding up parcels in anticipation of future upzonings, but for a heritage-protected neighborhood, this is obviously strained.
Hence, we can discard his thesis.

So what is the correct model of housing and land values?

Consider a simplified setting where land is zoned for either detached houses or six-storey apartments; developers can build houses on house-zoned land, and apartments on apartment-zoned land.
Upzoning means reallocating a parcel from house-zoning to apartment-zoning.
This makes apartment-zoned land more abundant and hence cheaper, while house-zoned land becomes scarcer and more expensive.
Since land is an input into housing, upzoning makes apartments cheaper and houses more expensive.

Condon does get one thing right: the upzoned parcel itself increases in value as it switches markets. 
But this 'own-parcel effect' is irrelevant for evaluating upzoning. 
Developers make decisions based on the market-wide price, not the price of a single parcel.
Upzoning makes apartment-developers better off, because it reduces the price of apartment-zoned land.
The upzoned parcel itself was previously _legally_ unavailable to apartment-developers, so making it available at _some_ price is an unambiguous improvement.

In this model, housing demand is the main driver of land values.
When demand to live in the city increases while supply is constrained, housing prices go up, which raises developers' willingness-to-pay for land.
This is why land values in First Shaughnessy have quadrupled: Vancouver has become more attractive to global elite CEO types who want to live in a mansion.
(Technically, land and housing prices are jointly determined; causality runs in both directions.)
Hence, the cause of the housing crisis is housing demand growing faster than supply, with rising land values being a symptom.
So Condon has misdiagnosed the problem, confusing cause with effect.

We can also see the problem with Condon's thesis by applying it more generally.
His view implies that it's never worth it to upgrade something, because upgrading just increases the cost.
For example, processing iron ore into steel just means you have to pay more for the finished product.
But of course, manufacturers can't use iron ore, just as apartment-developers can't use house-zoned land;
and the increased availability of steel makes it cheaper, so manufacturers are actually better off.
<!-- Similarly, a company paying for a worker to get an accounting degree just means they have to pay higher wages; -->
<!-- but if the untrained worker can't do accounting, -->

# A dogmatic rejection of supply and demand

In Condon's worldview, supply and demand cannot explain the housing market:
>The theory of supply and demand has been undercut by the observed economic reality [...] that no matter how many new housing units a metropolitan area adds, housing prices continue to rise. (p.56)

Condon attributes the problem to land values:
>[The] increase in urban land price seems to be caused by factors other than the supply and demand for new homes. The increase has to do with the innate limits on the availability of urban land and with how these limits make land perform uniquely in the global marketplace for "real" assets. (p.56)
<!-- need this quote? it does give the reader more context on Condon's thinking -->

For Condon, housing demand doesn't affect land prices, so he needs to find some other factor to explain why land values have increased.
As we've seen, his attempt to pin the problem on upzoning fails, and with it, his attempt to disprove supply and demand.

But a supply and demand model can neatly explain the data.
Demand to live in cities like Vancouver has increased, and restrictive zoning has prevented supply from keeping up.
This mismatch causes both higher housing prices and higher land values.

Condon is fond of claiming that Vancouver's city center has tripled the stock of homes, yet prices remain very high.
He is simply unable to conceive of demand being a cause of housing prices.

# A reliance on theoretical edge cases

To see how Condon relies on extreme theoretical edge cases, let's consider his numerical example showing that upzoning merely increases land values:

>Imagine a parcel of 4,000 square feet with an allowable floor surface ratio of one (FSR 1) that sells for $2 million dollars prior to rezoning. If the allowable density is doubled to a floor surface ratio of two (FSR 2), the redevelopment value increases in kind, forcing a near doubling in the value of the land to $4 million. Why?
>
>When the city authorities a doubling of market density without requiring affordability, the residual land price goes up in response. The city gets more efficient use of the land with the new density – all good – but gets no substantial decrease in the [price] per square foot of new housing. [...]
>
>In this example, with a market sale price of $1,000 per square foot of usable interior space, the developer would calculate a land-price residual of $500 per buildable square foot because that is what is left after paying for construction (at $250 per square foot) and for fees, constants, and profits (at a total of $250 per square foot). The developer can afford only up to $500 per buildable square foot, or roughly $4 million for land (i.e., 8,000 interior square feet at $500 per buildable square foot). [...] But note the land-price residual has doubled from $2 million to $4 million. And if the developer refuses to pay the $4 million, some other developer certainly will. (p.195-96)
<!-- what is the original land value residual? 
pre: 500psf * 4000sf = 2M
    - 1000psf price - 500psf costs
    - these variables don't change
    - WTP = (P-C)*S
    - upzoning increases S, so mechanically increases WTP
post: 500psf * 8000sf = 4M
-->

Note the last sentence: this entire argument depends on this tacked-on clause, though Condon does not realize it. 
When would a developer be willing to pay $4 million?
Only when demand for housing is perfectly elastic, so the demand curve is horizontal (see Fig 1a below).
In this case, shifting the supply of housing doesn't reduce the price, because supply always intersects demand at the same price.
So Condon is simply _assuming_ that upzoning does not reduce housing prices.

If we relax this assumption, then the demand curve slopes downward (as usual), and increasing supply reduces the price (Fig 1b).
For example, if a mass upzoning increases supply and causes housing prices to fall to $900psf, then the land price residual is now $400psf instead of $500psf. 
Hence, developers would only be willing to pay $400*8000 = $3.2M, instead of $4M.[^1]

<!--

1a: horizontal D

-->

Another problem is that Condon is focused on the land price of a single parcel, instead of the market-wide price of each type of land.
When the parcel is upzoned, it switches from FSR=1 to FSR=2. 
This makes the set of all FSR=1 parcels smaller by one, and the set of all FSR=2 parcels bigger by one.
So FSR=1 land becomes more expensive and FSR=2 land becomes cheaper.
But Condon completely ignores this effect, because he does not track land prices by type before and after the upzoning.

Finally, this argument doesn't even support Condon's thesis.
His claim is that higher land values are the cause of higher housing prices, and that upzoning is the main cause of rising land values.
But in this example, the goalposts have shifted: now the goal is to show that upzoning does not _reduce_ housing prices.
That's because Condon doesn't have a model of prices; by assuming perfectly elastic demand, he effectively takes prices as fixed, and determined outside of the model.
Hence, even if we set aside the reliance on a theoretical edge case, Condon is unable to support his thesis that upzoning increases housing prices.

# Inclusionary zoning 
<!-- # Inclusionary zoning... -->
<!-- ## ... does not fix the housing market -->

<!-- no acronym? -->
Condon favors inclusionary zoning (IZ) as a solution to the housing crisis, because it reduces land values.
Under the 'density bonus' version of IZ discussed by Condon (from Cambridge, MA), developers are granted permission to build extra density in exchange for making all units in the project Affordable (that is, available at subsidized prices).

Continuing the numerical example from above, if the city imposes a housing price of $750psf on the new Affordable units, then the developer's willingness-to-pay for land is: $750psf - $500psf = $250psf.
For 8,000sf (at FSR=2), this means the developer will pay up to $2M for the parcel, compared to $4M in the market-rate upzoning scenario.

For Condon, IZ reduces housing prices because it reduces land values:
>In this example, if a nonprofit housing corporation or co-op is assumed, the selling price per square foot drops from $1,000 to $750, with all of this price reduction attributable to lower land cost (p.197).

But this gets the causality backwards.
The lower housing price is not 'attributable' to the lower land price; rather, the regulated housing price directly causes the lower land price.
By artificially controlling the housing price, we reduce developers' willingness-to-pay for land, which in turn reduces the land price.
So the land price is a symptom, not a cause.

More generally, there's no necessary connection between lower land values and more-affordable housing.
We can always reduce the land price by reducing how much buyers are willing to pay.
For example, if we change the zoning to "parking lot only", the land value will certainly be reduced!
But obviously this will not make housing more affordable (in fact, the opposite).

Because the lower housing price is artificial, it does not reflect changes in supply or demand.
IZ is a _non_-market policy.
So it would be a mistake to conclude that IZ works like a cost-reduction policy, by reducing the price of housing inputs (namely, land).
Rather, IZ avoids the market entirely, and has no direct effect on the market forces that led to a housing price of $1,000psf.[^2]
<!-- Using IZ to reduce prices is like dipping a thermometer in cold water to reduce the air temperature. -->

This is an important point.
IZ doesn't address the question of how we make _market-rate_ housing more affordable.
Even though the vast majority of people live in market housing, Condon has no answers for them.
Because he rejects supply and demand, Condon has given up on fixing the housing market, and instead wants to switch to a non-market approach.

<!-- new section here? -->
<!-- ## ... and is a suboptimal policy -->


<!-- And as I've already pointed out, Condon is mistakenly focused on how upzoning affects the upzoned parcel's land price, instead of the market-wide price of land for each zoning type. -->
<!-- In fact, upzoning reduces the price of apartments by reducing the price of apartment-zoned land. -->

While IZ is a better than doing nothing, it is still worse than simple upzoning.
With Condon's version of IZ, the supply of market-rate housing cannot respond to increases in high-end demand, because only new subsidized units are allowed.
This causes a 'demand cascade', where unabsorbed demand at the top of the market cascades down and increases competition for low-end homes, which in turn forces poorer residents to look for non-market housing.
Hence, while IZ does increase the supply of subsidized homes, it also increases the need for subsidized housing.
IZ is self-defeating.[^3]

<!-- what about: zoning at height H vs zoning=H + Affordable units + tax cut
    - could be: tax cut is worth more than cost of Aff units
    - or: city pays cash for Aff units; can set cash high enough.
    - or: dev pays cash to city, city pays cash to dev; it's a wash?
- nothing can be better than no-zoning, which maximally allows S to keep up with D.
- how does "absorb demand increase" compare to "capture land value increase"?
    - different comparison: shifting D vs capturing land value 
    - can still do value capture under max upzoning
        - and this improves on max upzoning
-->

<!-- could do IZ money pump, and then discuss land value money pump -->
<!--  point is that  -->

Curiously, Condon only uses FSR=2 in his IZ example.
Why not go higher?
By adding more storeys, we can split the land cost across more homes, and offer the Affordable housing at an even lower price.
For example, if we instead use FSR=4, then we have 4,000 sqft of land * 4 FSR = 16,000 sqft of floor space.
We need the land value to be at least $2M to meet the landowner's reservation price (they can get $2M in the no-upzoning scenario).
At a total cost of $500 psf, that means we could set a housing price of $625psf.[^4]
This is a substantial saving on the $750psf with FSR=2.
But Condon shows no interest in higher-density Affordable housing.

We could even go higher, but the cost per sqft also increases with height.
Suppose that at FSR=8, the cost rises to $650psf.
Then we could set an Affordable housing price of $712.5psf, which is still an improvement on FSR=2.[^5]
This process stops when the per-unit cost is higher than the per-unit price.

Could we replicate this city-wide, tiling the town with towers of subsidized housing?
For Condon, there is no limiting force here, because market housing prices are not affected by supply (recall the constant $1,000psf).
But increasing the supply of subsidized homes does indirectly reduce market-rate prices, by inducing people to substitute away from market housing and into the non-market sector.
When demand falls, so does the price.
So the limiting factor on our tiling exercise is the market price falling below $712.5psf, since at that point, consumers would prefer market-rate housing instead.

But I suspect Condon does not want to acknowledge this, because it is precisely the same mechanism by which increasing the supply of new market-rate homes reduces the price of old housing.
A higher supply of expensive new homes induces some young professionals to upgrade from their cheap old apartment; this reduces demand for old apartments, and hence reduces their price.
This is an example of a [vacancy chain](https://www.buildingabundance.ca/p/vacancy-chains), since the young professionals vacate their initial unit.
<!-- this argument is orthogonal to land values, though; his argument is that upzoning can't reduce home prices because of higher land values -->
<!-- IZ still has problem of not absorbing demand increases -->

(footnote to upzoning windfall tax money pump)

<!-- another problem: IZ does not capture land value increases in SFH neighborhoods 
Condon is interested only in taxing land values of new homes, not old homes
-->


<!-- could cut this -->
<!-- A better approach is funded inclusionary zoning (FIZ), where Affordable homes are paid for out of general tax revenues.
IZ funds new Affordable units by cannibalizing other housing, which turns housing supply into a negative-sum game (because we lose new housing while demand keeps increasing).
In constrast, FIZ treats subsidized housing as a public good, to be provided by society as a whole.
[Portland](https://sightline.org/2024/02/23/now-fully-funded-portlands-affordability-mandate-should-be-a-model/) uses this approach by giving property tax cuts in exchange for requiring subsidized units in large apartment buildings. -->

[^1]: Is Condon committing a fallacy of composition here, instead of assuming perfectly elastic demand? That is, upzoning one parcel doesn't reduce housing prices, but upzoning the entire city would; and Condon is arguing from no effect of upzoning one parcel to no effect of upzoning all parcels. I don't think this fits. When demand is perfectly elastic, neither a single upzoning nor a mass upzoning has any effect on price. But if demand is downward-sloping, then upzoning even one parcel would decrease the housing price by a tiny amount, say to $999.99psf. But then it's obvious that a larger upzoning would reduce prices even more.

[^2]: Strictly speaking, there is some substitution effect, as new subsidized units reduces demand and prices in the market-rate sector.

[^3]: Versions of IZ that allow some market-rate housing alonside the Affordable units, and hence absorb demand increases, are better than versions that don't allow any market-rate housing.

[^4]: The land value is $2M = (P - C) * S, for housing price P, total cost C, and floor space S. Solving for P, we get: P = $2M/S + C = $2M/16,000sf + 500 = 125 + 500 = $625psf.

[^5]: For FSR=8, we have P = $2M/32,000sf + 650 = 62.52 + 650 = $712.5psf.
