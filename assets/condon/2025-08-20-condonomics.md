Condon claims to be a pragmatic empiricist, but actually relies on extreme theoretical scenarios.
He thinks in memes, not models.
The result is an incoherent analysis of housing policy.

# An incoherent theory of land values

Condon's thesis is that rising land values are responsible for increasing housing costs:
>The thesis of this volume [...] is that the housing crisis is not caused by an impeded supply of homes but by the asset value of the land below them. This Rent value is inflated when higher-density homes are authorized, much to the disappointment of those who argue that the housing-affordability problem is caused by constrained supply. (p.177)

In other words, since land is an input into the production of housing, higher land values will drive up housing costs.
And upzoning in particular is a primary cause of higher land values.

This view is superficially plausible. 
As a naive empiricist, Condon has observed rising housing prices and land values coincide with upzonings.
But what is the causal model underlying these correlations?
Condon's model is that upzoning is the primary driver of land values, which in turn cause higher housing prices.

Right away we can find a fatal flaw in this view: in First Shaughnessy, a heritage-protected mansion neighborhood in Vancouver, land values have quadrupled over 20 years, while building values have roughly doubled.
<!-- tripled? starts around 0.3-0.4? -->

(The graph for Vancouver overall is remarkably similar.)
The entire neighborhood of First Shaughnessy is a [heritage conservation area](https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/ODP/odp-heritage-conservation-area.pdf), so we have a clean natural experiment: no upzonings are happening here.
But then what is causing the increase in land values?
Condon has no answer.
He could appeal to speculators bidding up parcels in anticipation of future upzonings, but for a heritage-protected neighborhood, this is obviously strained.
Hence, we can discard his thesis.

So what is the correct model of housing and land values?

Consider a simplified setting where land is zoned for either detached houses or six-storey apartments; developers can build houses on house-zoned land, and apartments on apartment-zoned land.
Upzoning means reallocating a parcel from house-zoning to apartment-zoning.
This makes apartment-zoned land more abundant and hence cheaper, while house-zoned land becomes scarcer and more expensive.
Since land is an input into housing, upzoning makes apartments cheaper and houses more expensive.
(See [here](https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/2025/07/land_model) for a full writeup.)

Condon does get one thing right: the upzoned parcel itself increases in value as it switches markets. 
But this 'own-parcel effect' is irrelevant for evaluating upzoning. 
Developers make decisions based on the market-wide price, not the price of a single parcel.
Upzoning makes apartment-developers better off, because it reduces the price of apartment-zoned land.
The upzoned parcel itself was previously _legally_ unavailable to apartment-developers, so making it available at _some_ price is an unambiguous improvement.

In this model, housing demand is the main driver of land values.
When demand to live in the city increases while supply is constrained, housing prices go up, which raises developers' willingness-to-pay for land.
This is why land values in First Shaughnessy have quadrupled: Vancouver has become more attractive to global elite CEO types who want to live in a mansion.
(Technically, land and housing prices are jointly determined; causality runs in both directions.)
Hence, the cause of the housing crisis is housing demand growing faster than supply, with rising land values being a symptom.
So Condon has misdiagnosed the problem, confusing cause with effect.

We can also see the problem with Condon's thesis by applying it more generally.
His view implies that it's never worth it to upgrade something, because upgrading just increases the cost.
For example, processing iron ore into steel just means you have to pay more for the finished product.
But of course, manufacturers can't use iron ore, just as apartment-developers can't use house-zoned land;
and the increased availability of steel makes it cheaper, so manufacturers are actually better off.

<!-- but if the untrained worker can't do accounting, -->

# Condon dogmatically rejects supply and demand

In Condon's worldview, supply and demand cannot explain the housing market:
>The theory of supply and demand has been undercut by the observed economic reality [...] that no matter how many new housing units a metropolitan area adds, housing prices continue to rise. (p.56)

Condon attributes the problem to land values:
>[The] increase in urban land price seems to be caused by factors other than the supply and demand for new homes. The increase has to do with the innate limits on the availability of urban land and with how these limits make land perform uniquely in the global marketplace for "real" assets. (p.56)
<!-- need this quote? -->

For Condon, housing demand doesn't affect land prices, so he needs to find some other factor to explain why land values have increased.
As we've seen, his attempt to pin the problem on upzoning fails, and with it, his attempt to disprove supply and demand.

But a supply and demand model can neatly explain the data.
Demand to live in cities like Vancouver has increased, and restrictive zoning has prevented supply from keeping up.
This mismatch causes both higher housing prices and higher land values.

Condon is fond of claiming that Vancouver's city center has tripled the stock of homes, yet prices remain very high.
He is simply unable to conceive of demand being a cause of housing prices.

# Condon uses theoretical edge cases

To see how Condon relies on extreme theoretical edge cases, let's consider his numerical example showing that upzoning merely increases land values:

>Imagine a parcel of 4,000 square feet with an allowable floor surface ratio of one (FSR 1) that sells for $2 million dollars prior to rezoning. If the allowable density is doubled to a floor surface ratio of two (FSR 2), the redevelopment value increases in kind, forcing a near doubling in the value of the land to $4 million. Why?
>
>When the city authorities a doubling of market density without requiring affordability, the residual land price goes up in response. The city gets more efficient use of the land with the new density – all good – but gets no substantial decrease in the [price] per square foot of new housing. [...]
>
>In this example, with a market sale price of $1,000 per square foot of usable interior space, the developer would calculate a land-price residual of $500 per buildable square foot because that is what is left after paying for construction (at $250 per square foot) and for fees, constants, and profits (at a total of $250 per square foot). The developer can afford only up to $500 per buildable square foot, or roughly $4 million for land (i.e., 8,000 interior square feet at $500 per buildable square foot). [...] But note the land-price residual has doubled from $2 million to $4 million. And if the developer refuses to pay the $4 million, some other developer certainly will. (p.195-96)
<!-- what is the original land value residual? 
pre: 500psf * 4000sf = 2M
    - 1000psf price - 500psf costs
    - these variables don't change
    - WTP = (P-C)*S
    - upzoning increases S, so mechanically increases WTP
post: 500psf * 8000sf = 4M
-->

Note the last sentence: this entire argument depends on this tacked-on clause, though Condon does not realize it. 
When would a developer be willing to pay $4 million?
Only when demand for housing is perfectly elastic, so the demand curve is horizontal (see Fig 1a below).
In this case, shifting the supply of housing doesn't reduce the price, because supply always intersects demand at the same price.
So Condon is simply _assuming_ that upzoning does not reduce housing prices.

If we relax this assumption, then the demand curve slopes downward (as usual), and increasing supply reduces the price (Fig 1b).
For example, if a mass upzoning increases supply and causes housing prices to fall to $900psf, then the land price residual is now $400psf instead of $500psf. 
Hence, developers would only be willing to pay $400*8000 = $3.2M, instead of $4M.[^1]
<!-- Another way to see this is to look at the land market: upzoning makes apartment-zoned land more abundant, so it becomes cheaper. With lower input costs, apartments become cheaper to produce, and competition drives down price.
eh, haven't introduced two-sector land-housing model yet; here just have one housing sector.
-->


<!--

1a: horizontal D
1b: downward-sloping D
-->

Furthermore, remember that Condon's thesis is that higher land values are the cause of higher housing prices, and that upzoning is the main cause of rising land values.
But in this example, the goalposts have shifted: now the goal is to show that upzoning does not _reduce_ housing prices.
That's because Condon doesn't have a model of prices; by assuming perfectly elastic demand, he effectively takes prices as fixed, and determined outside of the model.
Hence, even if we set aside the reliance on a theoretical edge case, this argument does not support Condon's thesis that upzoning increases housing prices.

# inclusionary zoning

Condon favors inclusionary zoning (IZ) as a solution to the housing crisis, because it reduces land values.
Under the 'density bonus' version of IZ discussed by Condon (from Cambridge, MA), developers are granted permission to build extra density in exchange for making all units in the project Affordable.
<!-- available at subsidized prices -->
Continuing the numerical example from above, if the city imposes a housing price of $750psf on the new Affordable units, then the developer's willingness-to-pay for land is: $750psf - $500psf = $250psf.
For 8,000sf (at FSR=2), this means the developer will pay up to $2M for the parcel, compared to $4M in the market-rate scenario.

For Condon, IZ reduces housing prices because it reduces land values:
>In this example, if a nonprofit housing corporation or co-op is assumed, the selling price per square foot drops from $1,000 to $750, with all of this price reduction attributable to lower land cost (p.197).

But this gets the causality backwards.
The lower housing price is not 'attributable' to the lower land price; rather, the regulated housing price directly causes the lower land price.
By directly controlling the housing price, we reduce developers' willingness-to-pay for land, which in turn reduces the land price.
So the land price is a symptom, not a cause.

More generally, there's no necessary connection between lower land values and more-affordable housing.
We can always reduce the land price by reducing how much developers are willing to pay.
For example, if we change the zoning to "parking lot only", the land value will certainly be reduced!
But obviously this will not make housing more affordable (in fact, the opposite).

The problem with IZ is that it prevents supply from keeping up with increases in demand.
Developers are only interested in building in the first place because they noticed a shift in demand; for prices to stay flat, supply has to increase by the same amount.
Since IZ prevents developers from providing enough market-rate homes, it causes a demand cascade, where unabsorbed demand at the top of the market cascades down and increases competition for low-end homes.
Hence, while IZ does increase the supply of subsidized homes, it also increases the need for subsidized housing.
IZ is self-defeating.

<!-- density bonus is better than status quo zoning
but not as good as unconditional upzoning
how do we show that IZ is value capture? need to do taxes in GE model
 -->

<!-- could cut this -->
<!-- A better approach is funded inclusionary zoning (FIZ), where Affordable homes are paid for out of general tax revenues.
IZ funds new Affordable units by cannibalizing other housing, which turns housing supply into a negative-sum game (because we lose new housing while demand keeps increasing).
In constrast, FIZ treats subsidized housing as a public good, to be provided by society as a whole.
[Portland](https://sightline.org/2024/02/23/now-fully-funded-portlands-affordability-mandate-should-be-a-model/) uses this approach by giving property tax cuts in exchange for requiring subsidized units in large apartment buildings. -->
<!-- doesn't my argument apply against both?
condon proposal isn't pure unfunded, since giving density
unabsorbed demand increase: very general objection
could IZ act as a pure LVT? capturing land lift via required subsidized units, with no distortionary effect
need GE model? do comparative statics on IZ: compare demand shift with vs without IZ
 -->

<!-- - landowner reservation price:  -->
Note that Condon assumes the parcel initially sells for $2M; where does this number come from?
If instead the landowner's reservation price is $2.1M, then IZ kills the project: the developer is only willing to pay up to $2M, so no transaction occurs.
<!-- then the parcel wouldn't sell at 1 FSR either -->
This shows how IZ can reduce the quantity of homes, thereby raising prices.
<!-- (In general, Condon does not account for the landowner's reservation price.) -->

<!-- - IZ causes a demand cascade: unmet high-end demand pushes up low-end prices
    - developer is responding to demand increase, wants to provide all units at market-rate, including 'extra' units. -->

Finally, note that IZ doesn't help answer the question of how we make _market-rate_ housing more affordable.
Despite the vast majority of people living in market housing, Condon has given up and has no answers for them.

[^1]: Is Condon committing a fallacy of composition here, instead of assuming perfectly elastic demand? 
That is, upzoning one parcel doesn't reduce housing prices, but upzoning the entire city would; 
and Condon is arguing from no effect of upzoning one parcel to no effect of upzoning all parcels.
I don't think this fits.
When demand is perfectly elastic, neither a single upzoning nor a mass upzoning has any effect on price.
But if demand is downward-sloping, then upzoning even one parcel would decrease the housing price by a tiny amount, say to $999.99psf.
But then it's obvious that a larger upzoning would reduce prices even more.
